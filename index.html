        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Matthew Gimlin. I am a computer engineering major at Texas A&M
            University, and I am the loudest and proudest member of the Fightin' Texas
            Aggie class of 2024! I was born and raised in Elk Grove, California. I
            moved to McKinney, Texas in middle school, but I consider it to be my true
            hometown. Ever since I was a little kid, I have been fascinated by
            computers. I began playing video games at a young age, and I soon decided
            to make my own game. In doing so, I discovered something even better —
            programming. Since then, I have been constantly learning new computer
            skills, writing code, and creating software. In my time at college, I have
            expanded my interests into the field of electronics. I have come to love
            designing electronic circuits, as well as working with computer
            hardware.</p>

        <!-- interests section -->
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I am passionate about programming. I like to use my coding skills to build
            games because I find that it often requires clever solutions and smart
            programming. More specifically, I am interested in creating game engines.
            I am currently learning OpenGL to design my own custom game engine.
            Recently, I have also become interested in machine learning and artificial
            intelligence. In fact, I am planning to become involved in machine
            learning research this semester.</p>
        <p>Outside of computer engineering, I enjoy being active. I love to work out
            with friends at my apartment gym. I also enjoy rock climbing. I have been
            climbing since my freshman year of college in 2020. I like the physical
            challenge that it brings, as well as the puzzle-solving aspect. I spend a
            lot of my free time watching TV shows and movies. Some of my favorite
            shows include Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, and Community. My favorite
            movies include the Star Wars series, Interstellar, and Everything,
            Everywhere, All at once.</p>
