        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>I have the most experience in C, C++, and Python from personal projects
            and university courses. Also, I have experience with HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript, Verilog, ARMv8, and C#.</p>

        <h3>Libraries</h3>
        <p>I have experience working with TensorFlow for machine learning. I also am
            familiar with OpenGL.</p>

        <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>I have the most experience programming in Linux. I also have done some
            programming on Windows.</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>I use LTspice for circuit design and simulation in my university courses.</p>

        <!-- areas of interest section -->
        <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

        <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
        <p>I am interested in embedded systems because I enjoy working with both computer
            software and hardware. I enjoy low-level programming because it makes me
            think outside of the box, and it encourages me to learn about the hardware
            that I am working with.</p>

        <h3>Game Development</h3>
        <p>I enjoy game development because it often involves working with C and C++,
            which I have the most experience with. More importantly, I am able to create
            anything that I can think of. This often means that I have to think of
            creative solutions to implement features I want in a game.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>I am interested in machine learning due to what you can achieve with it. I
            believe that machine learning models can provide insight into complex
            problems. Also, there is a lot of math involved, which I enjoy.</p>
